- Get rid of atoi()
- Write a GStreamer sink element based on libam7xxx.
- Generate language bindings in order to use libam7xxx from other languages
  (this may not be necessary if the GStreamer sink works well enough).
- If there will ever be an API breakage, consider using more portable types
  (e.g.  off_t for file sizes, size_t for counters, etc.)
- uniform the style of if() checks in cmake files
- evaluate the use of error() instead of debug() for error paths
- make the switch_command in am7xxx-modeswitch more readable using the
  explicit bulk_cb_wrap structure from include/linux/usb/storage.h in the
  linux kernel.
