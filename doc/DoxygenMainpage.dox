@section libam7xxxIntro Introduction

libam7xxx is an Open Source library to communicate via USB with projectors and
Digital Picture Frames based on the Actions Micro AM7XXX family if ICs.

libam7xxx makes it possible to use these devices as USB displays on
non-Windows Operating Systems like GNU/Linux or Android/Linux just to name
a few, and on non-PC platforms like for instance mobile phones, tablets or
game consoles.

Check @link am7xxx.h @endlink for the public API documentation.

@section libam7xxxDesignOverview Design Overview

libam7xxx provides access to devices via two structs:

- A context, which manages aspects of thread safety when using
  multiple devices on multiple threads.
- A device, which talks to the hardware and manages transfers and configuration.

Either or both of these structs are passed to the functions in order
to interact with the hardware. The USB access is handled by
libusb-1.0, which should work in a mostly non-blocking fashion across
all platforms (see function documentation for specifics).

The API and the project structure has been inspired by
